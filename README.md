# ghost-on-docker
Example code for my article on how to run Ghostjs with Docker (Dev and Prod)

- Link to article: https://rameau.me/running-ghost-in-development-with-docker/

Branches:
- `main`: The initial code, from the first article
- `prod-example`: The example I created in the second article (will add link once it's published)
## Quick Note

I do not keep this repo up to date, so make sure to update the version of Ghostjs and MySQL to more up to date and supported versions at the time of reading.
